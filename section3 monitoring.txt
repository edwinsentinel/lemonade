11. How would you set up monitoring for the React Native mobile appâ€™s API endpoints?
 to setup monitoring for react native I would approach it as below;
        1. setup monitoring goals. ie what are we going to monitor things like availabuilty,performance,error rates or the usage
        2. instrument the mobile app- what i mean is Use monitoring libraries like Sentry, Datadog RUM, or Firebase Crashlytics for performance and error tracking.
        3. setup api monitoring tool eg psotman or new relic to monitor API health and performance externally.
        4. log aggregation and analysis-Send logs from the mobile app to a centralized log aggregation service like Logstash, Fluentd, or CloudWatch Logs and ensure i include metadata eg app version,user id for better context.
        5. performance monitoring by tracking response times effciency through new relic
        6.alerts and notifications- i would Set up alerts for API downtime, high latency, or elevated error rates.


12. Explain how you would debug high latency in the Node.js microservices.
to debug a high latency in a microservice i would;
        1. gather context- idnetify which endpoints are expereicning the latency as well as determine the issue consistency.
        2.collect data on response times,error rates and request volumes.
        3. i would simulate the load using psotmant and then Test the service independently to rule out issues caused by upstream or downstream dependencies.
        4. i would Use structured logging tools like Winston or Pino to log request/response times and service interactions.
        5. if no issue idnetified from above i would nowe check system resources eg cpu/memory usage by using top,htop to check and analyze the resources
        6.check also if the issue is caused by database queries or external APIs for third party calls.
